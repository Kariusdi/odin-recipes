    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>8 slices bacon</li>
      <li>Â½ white onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>2 slices tomato</li>
      <li>2 slices Swiss cheese</li>
      <li>1 malted wheat hamburger bun, split in half</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Place bacon in a skillet over medium heat, and cook until brown and
        crisp. Remove bacon from skillet and drain on paper towels.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the skillet to the heat and increase the temperature to
        medium-high. Add the onion and garlic, and stir fry until the onion is
        soft and the garlic begins to brown. Add the balsamic vinegar, and cook
        while stirring for one minute. Add the chopped mushrooms, and cook for
        three additional minutes. Remove pan from heat and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finely chop 4 slices of the bacon (reserving the remaining 4). In a
        medium bowl, combine the chopped bacon, ground beef, bread crumbs,
        Italian seasoning, Parmesan cheese, mushroom mixture and egg. Mix well
        using hands. Season with salt and pepper, and form into two patties.
      </li>
      <li>
        Open the two halves of the hamburger bun on an ungreased cookie sheet.
        Place one beef patty on each half, and cover each with one slice of
        tomato, 2 slices of the reserved bacon and one slice of Swiss cheese.
      </li>
      <li>Bake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until meat has cooked through.</li>
    </ol>
